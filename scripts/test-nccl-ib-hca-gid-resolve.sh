# CPU-only behavioral gates for the NCCL_IB_HCA -> RoCEv2 GID index resolver
# used by start-deepseek-v4-flash-dspark.sh's NCCL_IB_GID_AUTO=1 path.
#
# The resolver mirrors NCCL's selector semantics (parseStringList in
# src/misc/utils.cc) on the node that owns the sysfs tree: optional leading "^"
# (exclude), then optional "=" (exact match instead of prefix match), then
# comma-separated name[:port[:rail[:plane]]] tokens. Only the first 32
# non-empty entries are stored, and stored names use netIf::prefix's 63-byte
# payload. An absent *or empty* port field means any port; a non-empty one is
# atoi() (base 10, one conversion over the whole field), and a port outside
# the resolver's conservative nine-digit bound is clamped rather than evaluated, because $(( )) wraps
# modulo 2^64 and one such value wraps to the -1 wildcard. The selector is
# applied to the candidate universe ncclIbInit builds — ACTIVE ports with an
# Ethernet/InfiniBand link layer, separately capped at MAX_IB_DEVS=32 — so a
# DOWN sibling port neither fails the resolve nor
# constrains the index. Every selected member must validate against the match IP
# or an IPv4 on its own netdev; a member with no usable RoCEv2 GID fails closed
# (exit 1). Members are reconciled by intersecting their sets of usable indexes
# — a member can have several, so an arbitrary per-member pick would report a
# false disagreement — and only an empty intersection fails closed (exit 3),
# because NCCL_IB_GID_INDEX is one global value per rank.
#
# The suite extracts the launcher's own functions and runs the launcher's own
# generated lookup script through its unchanged local/SSH branches. Strict
# transport and `ip -4 -o addr show dev` stubs plus redirected fake sysfs trees
# keep the checks CPU-only while exercising the shipped boundaries. Running it
# against a pre-fix launcher fails behaviorally (wrong result / wrong exit
# code), not merely because a helper cannot be extracted.
